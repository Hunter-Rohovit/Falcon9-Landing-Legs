# The Build 
From Computer Aided Design to Physical Model, here is the building and iterative process!
## From First To Last Prototype

This image shows the process from my very first attempt to the final product. Starting on the left, I printed my first servo fitting test and from there made a few more modifications to the body itself. Additionally, I switched the position of the rotating control horn from the right side of the servo to the left, and switched out the type of servo for one with double the torque. The silver landing leg was my first landing leg print, which was too heavy for the servo to lift, so I changed the infill density from 40% down to 15% and it worked from there. The next two landing legs show the difference in print quality as a result of printing the landing leg vertically versus horizontally. The final landing leg with the servo attached shows my idea to use Loctite Epoxy so that the landing leg wouldn't slip on the motor shaft. The two sliders to the right, show the difference in rigidity between the first prototype and the second prototype. To get to the final slider design, I had to do a little bit of trial an error to get the proper amount of rigidity in the sliders while still allowing the sliders to actually slide. To do that, I adjusted the radius of the sliders until they slid to my liking. The second to last piece shows my final prototype before the full physical model. This prototype was made to ensure everything fit together properly. It took two iterations to get to the point, but it eventually worked. And finally, the last piece is the full, working physical model. <br>

Everything except for the servo motors was 3D printed on my Anycubic Chiron printer. <br>
