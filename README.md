# Falcon9-Landing-Legs
Here is my model of SpaceX's Falcon 9 with retractable landing legs. Fascinated by how easy SpaceX has made landing rocket boosters look, I decided to take my previous rocket modeling abilities to the next level adding controllable servo motors and infrared communication. Every part with the exception of the servo motors themselves was designed by me on Fusion360(you can find the stl files for all the parts I made under the 3DPrintedParts directory).
